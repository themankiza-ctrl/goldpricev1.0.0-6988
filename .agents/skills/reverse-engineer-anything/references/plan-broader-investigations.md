## Plan broader investigations

For requests that span multiple features or subsystems, use a staged workflow:

1. Turn the request into a checklist of questions and the evidence each answer
   needs. Resolve target identity and constraints from the conversation and
   workspace before asking for information again.
2. Inspect the current REA session, artifact identity, saved analysis database,
   bookmarks, and prior evidence. Reuse matching state; do not open duplicate
   sessions or repeat identical analysis.
3. Start with the smallest useful overview or inventory. Follow each question
   from its entry point through relevant data and state changes to its result.
   Batch related operations around a specific hypothesis, then expand only when
   the returned evidence leaves a concrete gap.
4. Inspect relevant packaged resources and configuration alongside code when
   they affect the question. Use format-aware inventory and parsers; do not
   infer behavior from filenames, strings, or layout alone.
5. Corroborate a conclusion with the evidence type it requires. Use runtime
   observation only when static evidence cannot answer the question and the
   required host runtime and OS access are available. For JavaScript behavior,
   run probes against the actual app through the available browser, Electron,
   or process capture workflow.
6. Decompose work into independent questions. When parallel workers are
   available and the questions do not depend on one another, assign distinct
   scopes, point workers to existing evidence, and ask them to return sources,
   conclusions, and unresolved gaps. Otherwise, work sequentially.
7. Keep a concise finding ledger linking each conclusion to Evidence IDs,
   confidence/evidence type, search boundary, and remaining unknowns. Update
   the shared index or investigation report so later passes can reuse results.

Before finishing, revisit the original checklist. Mark each question as
answered, partially answered, or unresolved based on its evidence; keep
bounded negative searches bounded, and do not describe a broad investigation
as complete while required questions remain open.
